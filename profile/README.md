# Welcome to Tensei Engine

Tensei Engine is an ambitious open-source project focused on building a versatile and high-performance game and application engine, crafted with TypeScript to empower developers, designers, and creators across various platforms.

## About Us

At Tensei Engine, we are on a mission to reshape the game development landscape. Our primary objectives include:

- 🌐 **Cross-Platform Excellence**: We're committed to delivering a game engine that seamlessly targets Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms. Our vision is to empower creators to reach a broad audience with their work.

- 🌈 **Openness and Flexibility**: Tensei Engine is open-source, and we believe in providing freedom to developers. Our permissive licensing, the Apache License 2.0, ensures that you can build the way you want without imposing restrictive conditions.

- ⚙️ **Efficiency at its Core**: While developed in TypeScript, Tensei Engine is engineered to be as efficient as possible. It incorporates advanced features like multithread support, ensuring that your applications run smoothly.

- 🔗 **Unifying Client and Server**: We're creating a unified codebase that bridges the gap between client-side and server-side development. This makes multiplayer games and applications more accessible and streamlined.

- 🧩 **Plugin-Friendly**: Tensei Engine is designed to support plugins and extensions. We believe in the power of a thriving ecosystem, enabling developers to add functionalities with ease.

- 👩‍💻 **Developer-Focused**: Our goal is to make Tensei Engine intuitive, catering to both developers and non-developers, including 3D modelers, designers, and audio professionals. Everyone can contribute their unique skills.

- 🧙 **Procedural Magic**: We aim to empower creators with procedural models and textures. Expect features like nodes for defining shapes, L-systems, and other algorithms to generate dynamic content out of the box.

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Creativity**: Tensei Engine will eventually offer a rich collection of AI-based algorithms for various purposes, including supporting NPCs in games, generating storylines and scripts, aiding in the development and generation of models and textures, and exploring the limitless potential of artificial intelligence in creative endeavors.

- 🪄 **Multi-Dimensional**: Tensei Engine is designed to cater to both 2D and 3D applications. We support a variety of rendering options, including the browser's built-in canvas for 2D, WebGL, and the cutting-edge WebGPU.

- 🧰 **All-In-One Toolkit**: Tensei Engine isn't just about graphics. We're crafting a comprehensive engine that includes a physics engine, asset manager, audio manager, scene manager, and a wealth of other systems to streamline your development process.

- 🌌 **Voxel World**: For those interested in voxel-based creations, we're offering built-in support to craft immersive voxel-based applications and games.
