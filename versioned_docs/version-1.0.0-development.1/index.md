## Getting Started

Get started with **using the runtime as a dependency**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Use the runtime as a dependency

In your package install the runtime as a dependency with:

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies that the runtime depends on.
